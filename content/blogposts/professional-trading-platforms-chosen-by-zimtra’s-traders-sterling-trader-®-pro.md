* All feature groups live in separate windows, which snap together to form a layout
* Window collections can form linked workflows - simply add desired windows to a group, and actions in one window will affect the whole group
* Target linked windows, click on target window to instantly update data in all the linked windows
* Save & Load layouts to support different strategies on the fly, or share with colleagues
* Save & export data from stock watch windows allows for easily organizing, populating and sharing stock watch windows
