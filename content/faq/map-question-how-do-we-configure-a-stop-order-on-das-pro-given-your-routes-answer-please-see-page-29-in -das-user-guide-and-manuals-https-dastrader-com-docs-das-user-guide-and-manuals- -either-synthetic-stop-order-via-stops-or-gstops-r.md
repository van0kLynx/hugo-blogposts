question: How do we configure a stop order on DAS PRO given your routes?
answer: >-
  Please see Page 29 in [DAS User Guide and

  synthetic STOP order via STOPS or GSTOPS routes.


  The GSTOPS route is a native stop order that goes directly to BATS (the only exchange that still accepts native stops) for execution.
