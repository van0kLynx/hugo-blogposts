question: Differences between the different data-packages of DAS, explained. Do
  we have any minimum data package in order to see level 1/2?
answer: >-
  The primary US market consists of 3 'tapes':


  Tape A - NYSE listed stocks (ie: BAC, META, etc.),

  Tape B - AMEX/ARCA and other exchanges (ie: SPY, GLD, etc.),

  Tape C - Nasdaq listed stocks (ie: AAPL, NVDA, etc.).


  For example, in order to see charts, prints and NBBO (national best bid offer) data in Tape A listed stocks, you need to have a NYSE level 1 market data subscription. Most traders typically want to have at least level 1 data for all tapes.


  The best value on DAS is the Level 1 Package, which includes level 1 for all 3 tapes and allows you to see charts, prints and NBBO data for all primary listed stocks.


  If you need depth of book data, its called Level 2 data, which is added on top of your level 1 data and provides a depth of book view (all available visible order flow for that market).
