question: Do I need to buy locates in all stocks I want to short?
answer: >-
  No, only if the stock you are interested in shorting is not easy to borrow.


  We have a huge easy to borrow list which is updated daily to provide our traders with the best shorting opportunities.


  However, not all stocks are on the easy list due to many factors, such stocks are known as hard to borrow and will require a locate before shorting.
